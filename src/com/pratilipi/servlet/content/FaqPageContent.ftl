<b>What is Pratilipi ?</b>
<br/>
We believe in the age old adage that "you become what you read". Owing to this philosophy we want to read good content, without any barriers. Pratilipi is a platform to encourage that. We want us to be able to discover, read and share our favourite content in any language, device and format of our choice. For more details read our <a href="/about">About</a> page.

<p>
<b>Who are the people behind Pratilipi ?</b>

We are five young Indians who are all united by our love for great content and awesome chai. If you love either of these things come and say '<a href="/about#team">Hi</a>'

<b>What does Pratilipi mean?</b>
<br/>
Pratilipi is a Sanskrit/Hindi word which means copy. We strongly believe that every time we read a book, a part of the book comes inside of us and we become a part of the book. As George R.R Martin said: "A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies, said Jojen. The man who never reads lives only one".
This is what Pratilipi means and stands for, to live more, and more meaningful lives.
